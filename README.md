# AutoHotkey
A list of my AutoHotKey scripts

I use a primary script that handles everything with the help of a few function script files.
The exception to this rule are scripts made for games, which are set to automatically close once the game closes, and the IFTTT Script, which is constantly running (though is called from the master script).
